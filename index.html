                <p class="smart-text paragraph">SMaT is a software solution for managing and automating academic and administrative processes in primary and secondary schools. Student registration, report generation and everything inbetween is taken care of. SMaT is web based and what this implies for schools that would be implementing it is that there would be almost zero investment cost on infrastructure. All that is needed is a functional computer with internet connection which most schools have already. For the admistrator, running the school becomes easier and more efficient. with this other important things can be focused upon. For the teachers, the work done in preparing reports and monitoring student performance is greatly reduced and output is gotten with even greater speed For parents, keeping an eye on their children's development becomes painless. With SMaT, the school would run more smoothly and all stakeholders get something either in form of speed, increased output, ease, efficiency, or unhindered access to information when, where and how it is most useful. We believe SMaT is a smart way to run your school and we suggest you should <a href="/smat-signup" style="color:rgba(12, 114, 181, 0.7);">try it out.</a></p>
